MIS545_Final_Project

The goal of this project was to apply the entire data mining process to solve a business problem.  I found a data set of over 3 million observations of network traffic and trained machine learning algorithms to be able to predict if future network traffic is malicious or normal. I created a Neural Network which took all of the data and predicted if the network traffic was normal with 85% accuracy. I also created a Support Vector Machine which takes attack observations and predicts the type of attack with >90% accuracy.
